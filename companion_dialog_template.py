  ("npc1_backstory_b", "I had a bit of a misunderstanding {s19}in {s20} about a horse that I found tied up outside the inn. It was the spitting image of a beast that threw me a few days back and ran off. Naturally I untied it for a closer look. As it turns out, the horse belonged to a merchant, a pinch-faced old goat who wouldn't accept that it all was a simple misunderstanding, and went off to get the guard."),

  ("npc1_payment", "I will be very useful to you, {sir/madame}, you can bet on that. Just one more thing before we leave, would you mind lending me {reg3} denars? I am ashamed to say it, but I have made myself a bit of debt here, staying in this tavern over the last few weeks and the tavern owners no longer believe that I am loaded with gold as I used to tell them. You know, things could get ugly here if they see me leaving with you before paying them."),

  ("npc1_rehire_speech", "Boss -- it's good to see you again. I know we had our differences in the past, but to tell you the truth, those were some of the best days I've known. And, to tell you the truth, I've had a bit of difficulty finding work. Listen, if you'd be willing to have me back, I'd be willing to sign up with your company again."),

  ("npc1_home_intro", "Boss -- did you know that I was born around here, in the high steppe? This is where I got my eye for horseflesh, because this is good land for horses, although a hard land for men. I suppose that's why the Khergits like it."),

  ("npc1_home_description", "Well, Khergits always lived here, even back in the old days, as the Emperor gave them gold and lands to keep out the other tribes. I'm told my grandfather was a Khergit chieftain, although my mother didn't know him, any more than I knew my father. When my mother was a lass, the Khergit started coming over the mountains in larger numbers, and now there's a Khergit Khan in Tulga."),

  ("npc1_home_description_2", "They go easy on us farming folk, and don't ask for much in tax -- not that we would be able to pay in any case. The land isn't good enough for most crops. Frankly, it's only good for horse-rearing, and that only for half of the year, in the winter after the rains. In the summer they take their herds back into the mountains. Caravans come over the hills and bring spice to Tulga, but we don't see much of that money down in the villages."),

  ("npc1_kingsupport_2", "Sure would, Boss. But let me tell you what might bring others to your cause -- particularly us poor folk.

  ("npc1_intel_mission", "Well, Boss, as it happens, I have a few cousins over in {s17}, and unlike some in my family, they can still stand the sight of me. They deal in horses --- I've even been able to supply them with stock from time to time -- and so they get to pick up a bit of the gossip round the castles and great halls of the {s18}.
