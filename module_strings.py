 Parrying attacks with your weapon is a little bit more difficult than blocking them with a shield.\

 If you are blocking upwards, you will parry any overhead swings coming against you, but you will not stop thrusts or attacks to your sides.\

 You must watch your opponent carefully and only initiate your parry AFTER the enemy starts to attack.\
 If you start BEFORE he readies an attack, you may parry the wrong way altogether!\

  ("npc1_backstory_b", "The first time I fought was in the battle of Chairneia and I was but a young lad desperate to earn my place amongst the heroes of legend. The taxeis I served in was placed on the right flank under the command of Basileus Philip himself. I was glad for it as it meant facing the Athenians rather than the Thebans who, at the time, still boasted a fearsome reputation. It seemed like the battle could go either way until we were ordered to retreat. Which was, of course, not a real retreat at all. It was bait for the less experienced Athenian army. They pursued us, breaking their ranks which proved to be fatal mistake... [...]"),
  ("npc2_backstory_b", "You may wonder, how did such a great champion end up here? It's a long story but unless you keep me supplied with drinks I will cut it short. The tribes of Samnium went to war with the Campanians and for a while things were going our way. That is, until they allied with the Romans. There were some victories and some defeats, the later saw me and some of my kin being captured and sold into slavery in Capua but it wasn't the end of it. Far from it."),

  ("npc4_backstory_b", "My previous raiding party disbanded after our last raid. Not because of it of course, we were good at it. We had years of practice raiding rival tribes and sometimes the Macedonians that settled a bit too close to Thracian lands. It's just that our village was burnt to the ground as we were away on a raid. With nothing to come back to and no means to exact revenge we all just went our separate ways."),

  ("npc7_backstory_b", "Take the wolves for instance, they are very dangerous in a pack but if you isolate them from the pack they are easy to kill. Lions? They are tough and many men have fallen prey to them thinking themselves to be stronger. You need to tire them out, what the lion has in raw strenght, it lacks in endurance. Chase it until he falls from exhaustion and then you can take him out with relative ease."),

[...] While at Hydaspes the battle almost had a turn for the worst but we pulled through. The losses were still considerable and most of the veterans agreed that it was enough fighting for a lifetime and begged Alexander to return home. What followed... [...] Ipsos was the final blow to my military career, serving under Antigonos seemed like my best option at the time but look where it got me, a homeless veteran whose only riches are his stories."),
  ("npc2_backstory_c", "The Campanians wanted to celebrate their victory and what more entertaining than making your enemies fight to the death for your entertainment? They pitted me and my kin against each other until only one would stand, with promises of freedom to the victor. You can guess where this went. My life was at stake and I did what I had to do to survive. The bastards didn't grant me the freedom they promised, instead they liked their little games so much that they turned it in something regular, everything was an excuse for me to fight some poor sod until one of us fell to his demise."),

I was lucky that the shore wasn't too far, I'm not a great swimmer but with the aid of an empty barrel I managed to reach the land.

I don't think I'm sticking here long enough to find out."),

So I borrowed some of his wealth without him knowing and set out to make a name for myself."),

The king must be chosen from one of the leading noble families of the land, by a council drawn by lot from the patricians of the cities of Jelkala, Veluca, and Yalen. The council meets on a field before Jelkala, and no man is allowed to appear in arms during their deliberations, on pain of death."),
 ("sarranid_rebellion_pretender_story_1", "I was born in a faraway land, to a humble family, and made a slave when I was but a girl -- but there is no shame in that, for the mothers of many of our kings were slaves. The old Sultan, Ayzar, spotted me in the markets and was struck by my beauty. I entered his household, and there he also learned to respect my intelligence. As he grew older, he allowed me to govern in his stead. First I managed the affairs of the palace, and later those of the realm."),

  ("swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_2",  "Yet when my father died, his cousin Harlaus convinced the nobles that no Swadian king of sound mind could name a woman as his heir. Harlaus said that his designation of me was the act of a madman, and thus had no legal standing, and that he, as my father's closest male relative, should of take the throne."),
  ("vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_2",   "I was smuggled abroad by a faithful servant, but now I am of age and have returned to reclaim what is rightfully mine. Burelek died soon after his act of perfidy -- the judgment of heaven, no doubt. His son Yaroglek now calls himself king, but as his claim is tainted, he is no less a usurper than his father, and I will topple him from his throne."),
  ("khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_2",  "According to Khergit custom, when a man dies his herds are split between all his sons, equally. So too it is with the khanate. When I heard of my father's death, I was away inspecting our borders, but I hurried home to Tulga, ready to give Sanjar his due and share the khanate with him. But when I arrived, I found that he rushed his supporters to the court, to have himself proclaimed as the sole khan."),
  ("nord_rebellion_pretender_story_2",     "My father died however before I completed my course of study, and as I hurried home to claim his throne my ship was wrecked by a storm. One of my father's thanes, Ragnar, seized this opportunity and spread rumors that I had died abroad. He summoned a gathering of his supporters to have himself proclaimed king, and has taken the past few years to consolidate his power."),
  ("rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_2",   "During the last selection, there were but two candidates, myself, and Lord Graveth. While the council was deliberating, Graveth appeared, sword in hand, telling them that a Swadian raiding party was about to descend on the field of deliberation -- which was true, by the way -- and if he were not elected king, then he would leave them to their fate."),
 ("sarranid_rebellion_pretender_story_2", "When Sultan Ayzar died, it seemed to the emirs of the realm only natural that I should succeed him as ruler, thus avoiding any danger of civil war. They insisted, however, that I should marry one of his generals, the Emir Baybak. The emirs then lined up to give us the oath of allegiance together -- to Baybak as Commander of the Armies, and to me as Mother of the Realm. For the brief time that we ruled, our realm prospered."),

  ("swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_3",  "I will admit that I did my cause no good by cursing Harlaus and all who listened to him as traitors, but I also believe that the magistrates who ruled in his favor were bought. No matter -- I will raise an army of loyal subjects, who would honour their old king's memory and will. And if anyone doubts that a woman can wield power, then I will prove them wrong by taking Harlaus' ill-gotten crown away from him."),
  ("vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_3",   "Until I have my rights restored in the sight of all the Vaegirs, I will bear the sobriquet, 'the Bastard', to remind me of what I must do."),
  ("khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_3",  "My brother thinks that Khergits will only respect strength: a leader who takes what he wants, when he wants it. But I think that he misreads the spirit of our people.--we admire a resolute leader, but even more we a just one, and we know that a man who does not respect his own brother's rights will not respect the rights of his followers."),
  ("nord_rebellion_pretender_story_3",     "So I remain in exile -- except now I am not looking for sages to tutor me in the wisdom of faraway lands, but warriors, to come with me back to the land of the Nords and regain my throne. If Ragnar doubts my ability to rule, then let him say so face to face, as we stare at each other over the rims of our shields. For a warrior can be a scholar, and a scholar a warrior, and to my mind, only one who combines the two is fit to be king!"),
  ("rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_3",   "Well, Graveth defeated the Swadians, and for that, as a Rhodok, I am grateful. When I am king, I will myself place the wreath of victory on his head. But after that I will have it separated from his shoulders, for by his actions he has shown himself a traitor to the Rhodok confederacy and its sacred custom."),
  ("sarranid_rebellion_pretender_story_3", "But alas, Baybak himself was soon killed in a skirmish with the Khergits. Had I known of his death in time, I would have been able to prepare myself against any possibility of betrayal. But alas, my husband's treacherous nephew Hakim came riding with his men, still covered with the dust of the battlefield, and drove me from the palace at swordpoint and proclaimed himself sultan. So be it -- I shall gather an army of my own, and return him the favor."),

  ("swadian_rebellion_monarch_response_1", "Isolla thinks she should be Queen of the Swadians? Well, King Esterich had a kind heart, and doted on his daughter, but a good-hearted king who doesn't use his head can be a curse to his people. Isolla may tell you stories of warrior queens of old, but you might also recall that all the old legends end in the same way -- with the Swadians crushed underfoot by the armies of the Calradic Emperor."),
  ("vaegir_rebellion_monarch_response_1",  "Were Valdym to come to me in peace, I would laden him with titles and honours, and he would become the greatest of my vassals. But as he comes in war, I will drag him before me in chains and make him acknowledge me as rightful sovereign, then cut his tongue from his mouth so that he cannot recant."),
  ("khergit_rebellion_monarch_response_1", "My brother Dustum has perhaps told you of his insistence upon splitting the khanate, as though it were a herd of sheep. Let me tell you something. Ever since the Khergits established themselves on this land, the death of every khan has had the same result -- the land was divided, the khan's sons went to war, and the strongest took it all anyway. I simply had the foresight to stave off the civil war in advance."),
  ("nord_rebellion_monarch_response_1",    "Lethwin 'Far-Seeker'? Lethwin Inkfingers, is more like it. Perhaps you have heard the expression, 'Unhappy is the land whose king is a child.' Unhappy too is the land whose king is a student. You want the Nords to be ruled by a beardless youth, whose hand bears no callouses left by a sword's grip, who has never stood in a shield wall? If Lethwin were king, his thanes would laugh at him to his face!"),
  ("rhodok_rebellion_monarch_response_1",  "No doubt Lord Kastor told you that I defiled the hallowed Rhodok custom by interfering with the patricians' election of a king. Well, let me tell you something. The patricians of the towns make longwinded speeches about our ancient liberties, but then choose as their king whichever noble last sat in their villa and sipped a fine wine and promised to overlook their unpaid taxes."),
  ("sarranid_rebellion_monarch_response_1", "Our scholars have long agreed that there is one overriding principle in politics. Men should accept the authority of the ruler, because tyranny is better than civil war. It was for that reason that I accepted the authority of both Baybak and Arwa, to whom I gave my oath as co-rulers."),

  ("swadian_rebellion_monarch_response_2", "Those who weep for the plight of a Swadian princess denied her father's throne should reflect instead on the fate of a Swadian herdswoman seized by a Vaegir raider and taken as chattel to the slave markets. Talk to me of queens and old stories when our warlike neighbors are vanquished, and our land is at peace."),
  ("vaegir_rebellion_monarch_response_2",  "Whatever my father may or may not have done to secure the throne does not matter. I have inherited it, and that is final. If every old claim were to be brought up anew, if every man's inheritance could be called into question at any time, then it would be the end of the institution of kingship, and we would live in a state of constant civil war."),
  ("khergit_rebellion_monarch_response_2", "Dustum would make a fine assessor of flocks, or adjudicator of land disputes. But can you imagine such a man as khan? We would be run off of our land in no time by our neighbors, and return to our old days of starving and freezing on the steppe."),
  ("nord_rebellion_monarch_response_2",    "Old Hakrim may have had fancy ideas about how to dispose of his kingdom, but it is not just royal blood that makes a King of the Nords. I am king by acclamation of the thanes, and by right of being the strongest. That counts for more than blood, and woe to any man in this land who says otherwise."),
  ("rhodok_rebellion_monarch_response_2",  "The only liberty that concerns them is their liberty to grow fat. Meanwhile, my men sleep out on the steppe, and eat dry bread and salt fish, and scan the horizon for burning villages, and shed our blood to keep the caravan routes open. Here's an idea -- if I ever meet a merchant who limps from a Khergit arrow-wound or a Swadian sword-stroke, then I'll say, 'Here's a man whose counsel is worth taking.'"),
  ("sarranid_rebellion_monarch_response_2", "You should know, however, that Arwa was not chosen as Baybak's partner because of her wisdom or love of justice. No, she was chosen because she was a witch, who could transform men like Ayzar and Baybak into stammering fools. No matter -- I was true to my oath, and respected her usurpation, until the very hour that it was invalidated by the death of her puppet. Now she must respect mine."),

The small bands of raiders who hovered just out of bowshot, waiting to pick off stragglers, were oddly a comfort -- at least water could be no more than a day's ride away.
